## Create React App Documentation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] and you can learn more here: (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Because it was created in this way there are the following scripts which will work in this project:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode and opens localhost 3000 to view the app in your browser.\

### `npm test`

This runs the tests in watch mode so selected tests will re-run as you edit the app.

### `npm run build`

This will get the app ready for deployment by bundling and optimizing React into the `build` folder.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

This allows you to build the app without the build tool, by copying all the configuration files and transitive dependencies to your local project, allowing you full control and pointing commands to these local files.
